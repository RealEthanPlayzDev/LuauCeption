# LuauCeption
Running Luau inside Luau. Inspired by [@Rerumu's LuauInLuau](https://gist.github.com/Rerumu/ecaf1de2f2b31d0fa91b9bac8e1e15d8).

## Notes
- ``strftime`` isn't implemented, os.date will NOT work
- Proper C exception handling not available

## Special thanks
- [@Rerumu](https://github.com/Rerumu) - a LOT of troubleshooting
- Tryptamine (@Lemonchat) - C exception handling
- gamerer123 (@Lemonchat) - pointing out a oversight in the V3 implementation (that broke number precision)
